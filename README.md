# NetPractice

## DESCRIPTION
- In this project we have to configure small-scale networks. Ranging over 10 levels with increasing difficulty, more and more concepts are introduced, like IP adresses, subnet masks, networks, subnetworks, switches and routers.
- Thanks to this modul I could learn some base knowledge about networking (for example ISO/OSI Modell, TCP/IP, IPv4, IPv6), and in particular especially about subnetting and how to distribute IP numbers among different subnets.
